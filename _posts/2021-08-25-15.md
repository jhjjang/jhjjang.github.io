title: Why You Should Use Async In Python.
---


**S**ince Python 3.5, it is possible to use asynchronism in your scripts. This evolution allowed the use of new keywords `async` and `await` along with the new module asyncio.

Async and Await were firstly introduced in C#, in order to structure non-blocking code in a similar fashion as you would write blocking code. These keywords were then exported to several programming languages as it facilitates the management of the asynchronous code.

Indeed, there are other ways of writing asynchronous code, if you know Javascript/Nodejs then you have probably already used callbacks:

```
fs = require('fs');
fs.writeFile('hello.txt', 'call back exemple in nodejs', (err) => {
  if (err) return console.log(err);
  console.log('file writen');
});
```

The callback function passed in the second position here will be called once the event is happening

Then there is also Promises that allow to better manage asynchronous calls with expressive words:

```
import axios from 'axios'let data;
axios.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")
  .then(resp => {
                data = resp.data//do data processing as data is actually available
})
  .catch(err => { console.log(err) })console.log(data)// undefined even if the instruction is after the API call
```

One of the problems with these techniques is that we get out of the horizontal reading flow of the code which impacts readability. Anyway, let’s get back to how it impacts you as a Python user.

## **The problem with standard IO code in Python.**

An IO code is an instruction that will call on an external service. This can for example be an HTTP request or a call to a database. The problem with standard python code is that your code if it only calls these services, will have to wait until these services respond before going on to the next instruction.

```
import requestsdata = (requests
       .get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")
       .json()
)# blocking code block, python waiting doing nothingfor d in data: # executed once the API has return
   print(d)
```

In the example above it is not very annoying because there is only one call to an external service but let’s take the code below.

```
def fetch_comments():
  data = []
  for i in range(1, 500):
    url = f"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/{i}"
    resp = requests.get(url).json()
    data.append(resp)fetch_comments()
```

This code took **126.95 seconds to complete** on my machine. We can therefore see that it is not optimal. We need to introduce parallelism, i.e. perform several requests at the same time.

## **Classical Way: Threads**

Before the appearance of asyncio in Python, to handle this kind of problem you had to use threads. A thread is a component of a process that can be managed concurrently. However, Python has a global interpreter lock which limits the use of threads to instructions not using interpreted code. This is not the case here because we use an external service. Without further ado here is the threads version of the code that calls the API.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
import threading
import queue
from typing import Dict, List
import requests

@dataclass
class ThreadRequests(object):
    urls: queue.Queue = queue.Queue()
    infos: queue.Queue = queue.Queue()

    def __init__(
        self,
        urls: List[str],
        http_method: str,
        nb_threads: int = 2,
    ) -> None:
        """Put all urls to the queue url """
        self.nb_threads = nb_threads
        self.http_method = http_method
        self.workers = {"GET": self.worker_get, "POST": self.worker_post}
        for url in urls:
            self.urls.put(url)

    @property
    def responses(self) -> List[Dict]:
        return list(self.infos.queue)

    def run(self) -> None:
        """ Run all workers"""
        for i in range(0, self.nb_threads):
            threading.Thread(target=self.workers[self.http_method], daemon=True).start()
        self.urls.join()

    def worker_get(self) -> None:
        """Pull a url from the queue and make a get request to endpoint"""
        while not self.urls.empty():
            url = self.urls.get()
            resp = requests.get(url)
            self.infos.put(resp.json())
            self.urls.task_done()

    def worker_post(self) -> None:
        """Pull a url from the queue and make a post request to endpoint"""
        while not self.urls.empty():
            url = self.urls.get()
            resp = requests.post(url)
            self.infos.put(resp.json())
            self.urls.task_done()

comments = [
    f"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/{id_}" for id_ in range(1, 500)
]
client = ThreadRequests(comments, "GET", nb_threads=5)
client.run()
```

Threads version of API calls source: author

As can be seen, the threaded version of the code requires more effort than the synchronous version. Indeed we must manage a queue that allows the threads to pick up the different URLs to process.

On the other hand, on my machine the execution of this code with 5 threads spawned took only **7.05 seconds to complete, a reduction of 94%** compared to the synchronous version. But if I tell you that we can do better.

## **Modern Way: Asynchronous code**

Let’s see how to make the API calls with async code.

```python
from typing import Callable, Coroutine, List
import aiohttp
import asyncio

async def http_get(session: aiohttp.ClientSession, url: str) -> Coroutine:
    """Execute an GET http call async """
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        resp = await response.json()
        return resp

async def http_post(session: aiohttp.ClientSession, url: str) -> Coroutine:
    """Execute an POST http call async """
    async with session.post(url) as response:
        resp = await response.json()
        return resp

async def fetch_all(urls: List, inner: Callable):
    """Gather many HTTP call made async """
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = []
        for url in urls:
            tasks.append(
                inner(
                    session,
                    url
                )
            )
        responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
        return responses

def run():
    comments = [f"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments/{id_}" for id_ in range(1,500)]
    responses = asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(fetch_all(comments, http_get))
    print(responses)

run()
```

Here too, there is more effort to produce to obtain the same results as the synchronous version and at least as much effort as the version with threads so is it worth the cost? On my machine, this code took **0.4880 seconds** to complete, you tell me.

So why does the async version perform so well compared to threads? Because spawning and managing threads are not free whereas the asynchronous version doesn’t need to manage these mechanisms.

## **Conclusion**

This article was intended to show you how asynchronous code can improve the performance of some of your tasks. There are lots of tutorials on the web to learn how to use this new paradigm in python.

Even though async has been supported in Python for a few years, you have to remember that not all old libraries support async because it implies having to rewrite the code. For example, you must have noticed that I could not use requests in the async example but aiohttp which the equivalent asynchronous version

If you are convinced and wish to switch to async, [aio-libs](https://github.com/aio-libs) repository provides a set of asyncio-based libraries and they may have one that fits your needs.
